## Sounds in Scratch 2.0 on Raspberry Pi

When using a sound block in a Scratch project for the first time, you may find there is a sound lag. If the sound is longer than a second then you may not hear the first second of the sound. For sounds shorter than one second, the sound may not play at all the first time the block is used. 

If you encounter this lag, running the script or clicking the sound block for a second time should result in the sound playing correctly.
