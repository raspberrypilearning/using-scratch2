## What next?
* [Simulate gravity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/gravity-simulator/) with Scratch.
* Why not [code your own Rock Band](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band/)?
* Perhaps you might [make a space animation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lost-in-space/)? 
* You could even find out about starting a [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) at your school for more fun with Scratch.
