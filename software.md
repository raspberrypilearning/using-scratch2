# Software Installation

After updating your SD card to the latest build, you should also install the Chromium mods which will enable the Flash player software. Then reboot your Raspberry Pi.

To install the software you need, run the following commands in a terminal (hold `ctrl` + `alt` + `t`):

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y rpi-chromium-mods
sudo reboot
```
